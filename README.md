# Waste Classification using CNN

## 🌱 Project Overview
This project applies **Deep Learning (Convolutional Neural Networks - CNNs)** to classify waste images into different categories such as plastic, paper, glass, metal, and more.  
The aim is to support **sustainable waste management** by automating waste segregation using AI.

## 🗓️ Week 1 - Data Exploration & Preprocessing

### ✅ Tasks Completed
- Collected local dataset named **`garbage-dataset`** containing 10 categories:
  - `battery`, `biological`, `cardboard`, `clothes`, `glass`, `metal`, `paper`, `plastic`, `shoes`, `trash`
- Verified dataset folder structure and class names
- Counted total images per category
- Displayed sample images for each class
- Checked image dimensions and consistency
- Created a preprocessing function (resize + normalize)
- Created train-validation split for CNN training (to be done in Week 2)
- Documented all steps in a Jupyter Notebook

## 🗓️ Week 2 - Model Building & Training

### ✅ Tasks Completed
- Built a CNN model using TensorFlow/Keras
- Trained it on 10 waste categories
- Evaluated validation accuracy and visualized learning curves
- Saved trained model for reuse
- Updated repository with new notebook

---

### 🔧 Improvisations & Enhancements (Week 2)
- Tuned CNN architecture for better accuracy
- Added dropout layer to reduce overfitting
- Visualized both training and validation accuracy/loss
- Cleaned dataset pipeline for efficiency
